# cubing

Current Skills (Monday, October 10): I am have very little experience with Rubix cubes and Pyraminxs as I have only done them a couple of times before, when I was a kid. Because of this, I don't know any patterns or algorithms as of right now that could help me solve them. Instead, I am simply experimenting with the cube in order to get a feel of how it works and what algorithms could solve it. I had a couple of sides almost solved by just trying to focus on solving one side, however there would always be an edge piece that would be in the wrong. I felt I have a good grip, the Pyraminx and am a bit more familiar with it. I hope to solve it by Friday but if I can't, then over the weekend. 

(Wednesday, October 12): In order to solve the Pyraminx with algorithm I can follow, I watched a few beginner tutorials on YouTube to figure it the easiest algorithms to get started with. This algorithm (R', L, R, L') helps to solve one side completely. This is helpful as I'm planning on solving the Pyraminx layer by layer. So far, the algorithm is working on getting the side almost completely solved. 

(Friday, October 14): I have using the algorithm from before but I keep ending up with the same problem. This is where one side is solved using the algorithm (R', L, R, L') but I have two of the same colored edge pieces at the top will be in the wrong place when they should be left or right. For example, two red edge pieces would be in blue when they should be in the blue on the right. This will happen with all the sides, except the one layer that is solved. 

(Monday, October 17): I solved it! I finally solved the entire Pyraminx over the weekend and I did using a specific algorithms. This algorithm is (R, U, R' U, R, U, R') or (R, U', R', U', R, U', R') depending on the situation. In order to solve the Pyraminx , I solved one side completely using the method from earlier and then looking at whether the two edge pieces that were misplaced (red pieces) should go on the right where the rest of the red pieces are or the left. If the two pieces needed to go left, I would use (R, U, R' U, R, U, R') but if the pieces needed to right in order to fit, I would use ((R, U', R', U', R, U', R'). I simply practiced this over the weekend and looking back at it the whole Pyraminx seems so simple!
