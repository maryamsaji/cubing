# cubing

Current Skills (Monday, October 10): I am have very little experience with Rubix cubes and Pyraminxs as I have only done them a couple of times before, when I was a kid. Because of this, I don't know any patterns or algorithms as of right now that could help me solve them. Instead, I am simply experimenting with the cube in order to get a feel of how it works and what algorithms could solve it. I had a couple of sides almost solved by just trying to focus on solving one side, however there would always be an edge piece that would be in the wrong. I felt I have a good grip, the Pyraminx and am a bit more familiar with it. I hope to solve it by Friday but if I can't, then over the weekend.
